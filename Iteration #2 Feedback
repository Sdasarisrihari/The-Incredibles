Remove UI branch. It's good practice to clean up after a branch has outlived it's purpose, been merged to main.
The README.md file is to explain to the user how they can run your application. Nothing else should be in the file. I didn't find it clear enough to succeed in running the application.
	Python3 Flask Random These 3 are required to be installed on system to run this project. Where are these found and how are they installed.
	The instructions say run the application.py file. How is this done?
Code:
	application.py
		ap()
			Method name isn't helpful to the reader of this code. Code will be read 100 times for every time it is written.
			There is an if statement that appears to have the same code in the if clause as the else clause. If there is a difference it should be factored out. This should likely be two methods.
			I'm still not clear on what 511 means.
	game.py
		Notice how many times the number 5 appears in the code. Your code would be more readable by making this a constant.
	gamePage.html
		I liked the instructions being easy to pop up and dismiss.
