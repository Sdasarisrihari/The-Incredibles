application.py - 
A lot going on in little code. could be simplified and refactored a bit. Especially mainPageRollClicked()
I didn't understand this line: # Dice Value 511 has null so we initialise with that

utils.py - 
Good small functions - great little wrapper of some functions.

test.py - 
Some useful here, but these feel bigger than unit tests as they are doing a whole game not a round or smaller. Please add micro or unit tests.

game.py - 
Bigger methods than best practice calls for. A little odd logic for determining game over.
